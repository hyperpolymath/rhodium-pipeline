PALIMPSEST LAYER
================================================================================

1. PRESERVATION OF METHODOLOGY

   Any derivative work must preserve attribution to the Rhodium Standard
   Repositories (RSR) methodology. This includes:

   c) Contributing improvements back to the community where practical

2. PROOF INTEGRITY

   If formal proofs (Isabelle/HOL, Lean, Coq, or similar) are included:

   a) Proofs must remain verifiable with their stated proof assistant
   b) Modifications to proofs must be clearly marked
   c) Proof dependencies must be accurately documented

3. CONFIGURATION TRANSPARENCY

   Generated projects must not obscure their configuration systems:

   a) Nickel contracts must remain readable (no obfuscation)
   b) Guile schemes must remain inspectable
   c) Build configuration must be auditable

4. TOOLCHAIN DOCUMENTATION

   Projects must document their complete toolchain requirements:

   a) All runtime dependencies
   b) All build-time dependencies
   c) All proof-checking dependencies
